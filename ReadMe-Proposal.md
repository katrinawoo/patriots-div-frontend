## Overview

Patriots Division is a start up that develops video games, they need an app to convey information about their company and team to potential investors and employees, this is where StartSite comes in.

My project is divided into two phases. 

In Phase 1, I will build a company website featuring company info, their values,  team bios, job postings it’ll have the ability to apply for them through the site, and a messaging functionality.   This is the Brainstation Capstone project.

In Phase 2, I will create a template from this website and deploy it in an app, allowing other startups to easily customize and maintain their own sites.


### Problem

The way that most startups communicate information to potential investors is through slides decks that are not as exciting to look at or as easy to access as an app or website.  Most investors look at a deck a few times around the time of a presentation, but then it gets lost amongst their other links and files.  By having an app, the important information about a company is easily accessible in the future.  Many startups are eager to set up a digital presence, but there is considerable expense to doing so.  This app creates a template that could make building team websites for startups more attainable.

Many startups struggle with creating a professional online presence, and the question is, why does a website matter? Startups often rely on social media but they lack a credible website that showcases their team and open job opportunities. However, as these companies try to grow, attract talent, and fundraise, it is challenging for them to appeal to outside investors without establishing a professional persona and trustworthy company presence.  These issues are helped by establishing a website, making it easier for stakeholders to access essential information about the company.


### User Profile

StartSite could be for any company wanting to build an app to convey information about their company, team, and potential employment opportunities.  Many companies work on multiple projects/startups, so a separate team site may be suitable.
